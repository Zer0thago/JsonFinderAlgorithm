# JSON Extractor
This C++ program reads an input file, searches for a JSON object
(enclosed by curly braces {}), and writes the JSON object to an output file after removing any forward slashes /.
## Requirements
C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
## Compilation
To compile the program, run the following command in your terminal:
´´´ bash
g++ -o JsonFinderAlgo main.cpp
´´´
This will generate an executable file named json_extractor.
